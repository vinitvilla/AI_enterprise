I'm providing the answer for why I did choose GitHub instead of GitLab.

In my experience, I have worked with both github and gitlab. Both has the uniqueness in their own way.

If the project which I'm doing rightnow is about managing the group of people and collabarting with them and assign them roles, then I might of gone with gitlab. that is a complete organizational structure.

But this is a simple project with just a file to upload so I felt gitHub is enough to get the things done.

Good day :)
